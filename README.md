# Trofeo Motorsports
This was an exercise in front end web design of a simple, static site. The premise of this site was a client that needed existing clients and new comers alike to understand what services are offered by the race team intructors and the track.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for this site.

## The Process:
-- Brainstorming
The first, and most important question to answer is "what is the purpose for this app or site?". The next question that follows is who is this for? Will employees be using the site, or is it just for customers? Will a sign in and internal portal be required? Will This site store any user data in a database? The answers to these questions change the design process and how much time to dedicate to factors like security, SEO, performance optimization, etc.

This site was slated to be a static site that would not have login functionality, and would just provide potential clients information for the services offered. As such, the primary focus was aesthetic styling, a logical layout, and a memorable user experience.

-- Wireframing
Though wireframing can be done by hand or digitally, I find the practice of drawing the basic layout of a site by hand helps me focus on the basics first. (It's all too easy to get wrapped up in color schemes, features, and implementing random ideas, but first, we need a framework!) 

The most basic wireframe sketches reflect both mobile and desktop app/site views. It is now considered best practice to use a mobile first approach; it is pretty straigh forward to design with mobile in mind and then recongigure for desktop later on (the opposite is not necessarlicy true).

-- Write Copy
It is now time to ditch the Lore Ipsum filler text. This is where having a clear-cut idea of what the app or site is meant to do, and who your audience is really comes into play. What do you want users to know? How can you help them find the information the need easily? Have you clearly and thoroughly explained the products/services offered?

Clients don't always (or even usually) provide all these little details, so you might have to get a bit creative and really dig deep to understand waht they need to be able to communicate that to potential app or site visitors.

-- Progressive Enhancement
Progressive enhancement is a methodology that focuses on laying down the most basic information down as a foundation, and THEN styling and fine-tuning to fit the desired aesthetic.

First, HTML. I added all the basic elements and text I would later use to style the site.

CSS. This is where the bulk of the styling took place. From picking color schemes, to fonts, to centering that one troublesome <div>, it happened here.

JS. This was the last step because is was the icing on the cake. It took the site from being "just" a static site to reacting to user inputs. Buttons changing color when you hover over them, special effects, you name it. This is where Javasprict becomes extremely useful.

-- Modifications (as neccessary)

## Optimizations

## Lessons Learned:
- First and foremost - DON'T GIVE UP! If a rookie like me can piece a site together, than so can you.
- Have a plan, and stick to it unless there's a fundamental design reason your idea won't work. The more you change your approach, the more room for confusion you create.
- Take notes. If it's the first time you're trying a concept, expect you'll hit a snag. The better you document what you've tried, what worked, and WHY, the better things will click the second time around. And if they don't click? Check out your notes!
